### Bar Chart 
* Number of times goods from each aisle were reorderd within the beverage department. 
```{r - bar chart}
count %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~aisle, y = ~reordered, color = ~aisle, type = "bar", text = ~aisle) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Aisle Category"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Total items reordered"))

```

### Boxplot
* Number of times goods from each aisle were reorderd within the beverage department. 

```{r - boxplot}
count %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~aisle, y = ~reordered, color = ~aisle, type = "box", text = ~aisle) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = ""),
         yaxis = list(title = "Total items reordered"))
